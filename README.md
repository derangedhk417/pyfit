# pyfit
System for training neural networks to interpolate DFT data. 

## Overview

pyfit uses pytorch to train feed forward, fully connected neural networks to interpolate DFT potential energies for atomic structures. It is designed specifically to train neural networks using a special feature set developed for this task. This feature set is documented [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10343-5.pdf?origin=ppub).
